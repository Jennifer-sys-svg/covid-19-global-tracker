# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project is a data analysis notebook that explores global COVID-19 trends using the OWID (Our World in Data) dataset. It includes data exploration, basic visualizations, and insights drawn from pandemic-related statistics.

## üìå Project Objectives

- Load and explore a real-world dataset using `pandas`
- Visualize COVID-19 trends with `matplotlib`
- Understand infection, testing, and vaccination patterns globally
- Share meaningful insights from the data

## üõ† Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib

## üöÄ How to Run/View the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `covid_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code with Jupyter support.
3. Ensure the dataset (`owid-covid-data.csv`) is present in the same folder as the notebook.
4. Run all cells from start to finish.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The dataset file is large and not included in this repository due to GitHub's file size limit. You can download it manually from [OWID COVID-19 Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) or [GitHub](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data).

## üí° Insights and Reflections

- The COVID-19 pandemic affected countries differently in terms of cases, deaths, and vaccine rollout.
- Some nations had very high testing rates while others reported low numbers due to limited resources.
- Data analysis can offer valuable insight into global health trends and inform better decision-making in future crises.
